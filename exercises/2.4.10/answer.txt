2.4.10 Suppose that we wish to avoid wasting one position in a heap-ordered
array pq[], putting the largest value in pq[0], its children in pq[1] and pq[2],
and so forth, proceeding in level order. Where are the parents and children of
pq[k]?
parent, child1, child2
0, 1, 2
1, 3, 4
2, 5, 6
3, 7, 8
4, 9, 10
5, 11, 12
6, 13, 14
7, 15, 16
8, 17, 18

The parent of pq[k] is at pq[(k - 1) / 2]. The children of pq[k] are at pq[2 * k
+ 1 and 2 * k + 2].

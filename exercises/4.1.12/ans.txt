See 4.1.11 for the tree.

In a BFS tree, the distance between v and w, when neither is the root, is the
number of vertices on a path from v to w. The path from v to w can be
constructed by starting from v, going up the tree until a parent common to v and
w are found, then going down the tree to w. All vertices along this tree
traversal constitutes the path from v to w.

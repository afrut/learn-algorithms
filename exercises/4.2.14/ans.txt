A strongly connected component in the directec graph G are vertices that are
part of a general directed cycle.

In GR, the direction of the general directed cycle would be reversed. But, the
general directed cycle would still be present and would still connect the same
vertices.

Thus, the strong component in G would be the same strong component in GR.

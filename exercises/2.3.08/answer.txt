2.3.8 About how many compares will Quick.sort() make when sorting an array of
N items that are all equal?

When all items are equal, the inner loop of partition only terminates when i >=
j. This can only occur when at least hi - lo + 1 compares are made. Since hi
- lo + 1 takes values of N - 1, N - 2, N - 3, ...,  1, the number of compares of
the inner loop is at least N - 1 + N - 2 + N - 3 + ... + 1 = N(N - 1)/2. So,
QuickSort is O(N^2) for an array that has all equal elements.

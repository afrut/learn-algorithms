2.2.4 Does the abstract in-place merge produce proper output if and only if the
two input subarrays are in sorted order? Prove your answer, or provide a
counterexample.

Yes, both subarrays have to be sorted for the abstract in-place merge to produce
proper output. Consider the two following subarrays:
a = [0 2 4 6 8 10]        b = [1 3 11 5 7 9]

When the second index is referring to b[2] = 11, the elements of the first array
will always be less than the value 11. So, merge() will put all elements of
subarray a into output. Then, it will detect that subarray a is empty and copy
the rest of the elements of array b to output. This will produce the following
incorrect output:
0 1 2 3 4 6 8 10 11 5 7 9

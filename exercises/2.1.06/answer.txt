2.1.6 Which method runs faster for an array with all keys identical, selection sort or
insertion sort?

Insertion sort. When running insertion sort on an array of all identical items,
the inner loop to immediately terminates and only uses N - 1 compares.

When running selection sort on an array of all identical items, the inner loop
does not terminate but continues as usual. This uses (N)(N - 1)/2 compares.

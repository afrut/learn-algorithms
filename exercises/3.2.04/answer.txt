3.2.4 Suppose that a certain BST has keys that are integers between 1 and 10,
and we search for 5. Which sequence below cannot be the sequence of keys
examined?
a. 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5
b. 4, 10, 8, 7, 53
c. 1, 10, 2, 9, 3, 8, 4, 7, 6, 5
d. 2, 7, 3, 8, 4, 5
e. 1, 2, 10, 4, 8, 5

b. is impossible. After examining 7, get() should examine left link of 7 and 53
cannot be at the left link of 7.

Computing the reverse postorder of a digraph using depth-first search always
results in a topological order. That is, it always places source vertices before
destination vertices. Given this property, there cannot be a topological order
that does not result from DFS-based algorithm as the algorithm FORCES the
ordering of source vertices before destination vertices. All variations of
topological orders can be derived from using DFS and varying the order in which
vertices are visited.

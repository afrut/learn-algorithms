A heap is O(lg(N)) for both insert and remove the maximum operations. An
unordered array is O(1) for insert and O(N) for remove the maximum. An ordered
array is O(N) for insert and O(1) for remove the maximum.

Given that there are only a few remove the maximum operations, an unordered
array implementation of the priority is appropriate.

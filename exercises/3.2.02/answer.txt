3.2.2 Inserting the keys in the order A X C S E R H into an initially empty BST
gives a worst-case tree where every node has one null link, except one at the
bottom, which has two null links. Give five other orderings of these keys that
produce worst-case trees.

A C E H R S X
X S R H E C A
A X C E H R S
X A S R H E C
X A C E H R S

The state of any 2-3 tree is between two extremes: a 2-3 tree
comprising purely of either 2-nodes, or one purely of 3-nodes. For a given
number of elements N, a 2-3 tree is shortest when the N nodes are all 3-nodes
and it is longest when all the nodes are all 2-nodes. A 2-3 tree of all
3-nodes becomes one with some 2-nodes after a put operation. This is because a
4-node will form and will eventually get passed to the root.

A 2-3 tree of all 3-nodes has a height of log3(N) while one with all
2-nodes has a height of log2(N). Since a 2-3 tree is either all 3-nodes,
all 2-nodes, or a mixed combination, the height of a 2-3 tree is between
log3(N) and log2(N).

2.5.1 Consider the following implementation of the compareTo() method for String.
How does the third line help with efficiency?

public int compareTo(String that)
{
    if (this == that) return 0; // this line
    int n = Math.min(this.length(), that.length());
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    {
        if (this.charAt(i) < that.charAt(i)) return -1;
        else if (this.charAt(i) > that.charAt(i)) return +1;
    }
    return this.length() - that.length();
}

It helps by determining if the reference passed in is the same as the reference
to the current String object. If it is, it

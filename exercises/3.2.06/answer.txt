3.2.6 Add to BST a method height() that computes the height of the tree.
Develop two implementations: a recursive method (which takes linear time and
space proportional to the height), and a method like size() that adds a field
to each node in the tree (and takes linear space and constant time per query).

See libs\algs\RecursiveBST.java. heightCompute() and height() are the relevant
methods.

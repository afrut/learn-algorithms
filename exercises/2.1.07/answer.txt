2.1.7 Which method runs faster for an array in reverse order, selection sort or insertion
sort?

Selection sort always uses the same number of compares regardless of input. This
uses (N)(N - 1)/2 compares.

When running insertion sort on input in reverse order, it takes the same number
of compares as selection sort. This is because the "element in consideration"
is guaranteed to be moved to spot 0 in the array, every single time.

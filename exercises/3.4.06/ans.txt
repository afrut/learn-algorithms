There are 3 "realizations" that go into proving this:
- In modular hashing, a collision occurs between two keys when the difference
between the two keys are exactly M.
- Powers of 2 will never be the multiple of a prime greater than 2.
- Two t-bit integers that differ by only 1 bit in the same location will differ
by a power of 2. If they differ by the last bit, then both integers will differ
by 1.

Since the two integers will always differ by a multiple of 2 or 1, they will
always have different hash values.

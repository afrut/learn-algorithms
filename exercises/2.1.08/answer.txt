2.1.8 Suppose that we use insertion sort on a randomly ordered array where elements
have only one of three values. Is the running time linear, quadratic, or something in
between?

Insertion sort's running time is linear for an array with repeated elements that
is already sorted. It is quadratic when the array is in reverse order and
contains all distinct elements.

For an array in reverse order with repeated elements (since there are only 3
possible elements), the running time for insertion sort will be less than
quadratic but greater than linear.

This is because insertion sort will always use at least N - 1 compares before
the inner loop terminates early. When there are repeated elements, the inner loop
tends to terminate earlier more often. So, having repeated elements reduces the
number of compares.

The following simple path is taken into consideration:
0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4

In the transitive closure
- 0 will have 4 outgoing edges
- 1 will have 3 outgoing edges
- 2 will have 2 outgoing edges
- 3 will have 1 outgoing edge
This is a total of 10 edges.

V, number of edges in transitive closure
2, 1
3, 3
4, 6
5, 10

The transitive closure will have V(V - 1) / 2 edges.

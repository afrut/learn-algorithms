2.2.7 Show that the number of compares used by mergesort is monotonically
increasing (C(N+1) > C(N) for all N > 0).

It is known that the number of compares within merge is N/2 at best, and N at
worst. Since merge() is called lgN times, this makes the best-case and
worst-case N/2*lgN and N*lgN, respectively. Both cases are monotonically
increasing functions. Furthermore, from examining code, adding more elements can
only lead to more compares. Adding more elements cannot lead to a decrease in
the number of compares.

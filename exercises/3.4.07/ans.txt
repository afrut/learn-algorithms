A set of hash codes with a uniform distribution is evenly distributed among bins
by any number M; even if M is not prime.

However, a problem arises when the distribution of hash codes. Take for example
a set of hash codes where hash codes k that are multiples of 4 are more common
than other hash codes. Any value M that shares a factor with 4 will be unable
to uniformly distribute the hash codes. In particular, this means any M that is
a multiple of 2 or 4.

So, choosing a to be a prime will not be sufficient enough to distribute hash
codes uniformly among bins. This is because, if M is not prime, it will have a
higher probability of sharing a common factor with any one of the hash codes.
This is made worse if hash codes that share a common factor with M are more
common than others leading uneven distribution when hashing.

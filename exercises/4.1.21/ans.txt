Same as 4.1.20. See mylibs.GraphTwoColorRecursiveDFS.

The constructor accesses each vertex once so there are at least V accesses to
marked[].

When processing each vertex v, depth-first search checks marked[] yet again for
every vertex w adjacent to v. In other words, dfs accesses marked for each
edge connected to v.

In the worst case, every vertex is connected by an edge to every other vertex
so that the order of growth is V * (V - 1) or O(V2). This can be avoided by
breaking early as soon as isBipartite is set to false by using an explicit
stack as opposed to using the system stack via recursion.

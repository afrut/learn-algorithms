In a fully connected graph, a vertex that is removed that does not disconnect
the graph is a vertex that is connected to marked vertices. Such vertices are
visited last, at which point all other vertices are marked. Every graph will
have these types of vertices since there will always be at least one vertex that
is visited last.


For example, in a graph of 3 points and 2 edges:

1----2----3

Vertices 1 and 3 can be removed without without disconnecting the graph. If the
source is 1, 3 is visited last either by depth-first or breadth-first search. If
2 is the source, either 1 or 3 will be visited last. If 3 is the source, 1 will
be visited last.

If 1 and 3 were connected, a cycle is created. In this situation, any vertex can
be removed without disconnecting the graph.

Based on this graph, a proof by induction can be formulated. It has been shown
that such a vertex exists for a graph of 3 vertices. If a fourth vertex were to
be added, it would be an endpoint, which can be removed without disconnecting
the graph. If the fourth vertex forms a cycle, any of the vertices forming the
cycle an be removed without disconnecting the graph. The same is true if a 5th
vertex were to be added. So, any graph with any number of vertices will have at
least 1 vertex that can be removed without disconnecting the graph.

2.4.12 Suppose that your application will have a huge number of find the maximum
operations, but a relatively small number of insert and remove the maximum
operations. Which priority-queue implementation do you think would be most
effective: heap, unordered array, or ordered array? 

A heap is O(lg(N)) for both insert and remove the maximum operations, and O(1)
for find the maximum.

An unordered array is O(1) for insert, O(N) for remove the maximum, and O(N) for
find the maximum.

An ordered array is O(N) for insert, O(1) for remove the maximum, and O(1) for
find the maximum.

Given that there are few insert and remove the maximum operations, an ordered
array implementation of the priority queue is appropriate.

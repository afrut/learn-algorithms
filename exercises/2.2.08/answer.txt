2.2.8 Suppose that Algorithm 2.4 is modified to skip the call on merge()
whenever a[mid] <= a[mid+1]. Prove that the number of compares used to mergesort
a sorted array is linear.

The number of compares is the number of calls to sort(a, lo, hi) where lo < hi.
See the following counts for different N:
N = 2
1

N = 4
2
1

N = 8
4
2
1

N = 16
8
4
2
1

N = 32
16
8
4
2
1

The pattern is to continuously divide N by 2 and add all such results. The exact
count is N - 1, which makes the number of compares linear.

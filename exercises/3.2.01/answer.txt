3.2.1 Draw the BST that results when you insert the keys E A S Y Q U E S T I O
N, in that order (associating the value i with the ith key, as per the
convention in the text) into an initially empty tree. How many compares are
needed to build the tree?

E - 0 - 0 compares; compare with null
A - 1 - 1 compares; compare with E
S - 2 - 1 compares; compare with E
Y - 3 - 2 compares; compare with E, S
Q - 4 - 2 compares; compare with E, S
U - 5 - 3 compares; compare with E, S, Y
E - 6 - 1 compares; compare with E
S - 7 - 2 compares; compare with E, S
T - 8 - 4 compares; compare with E, S, Y, U
I - 9 - 3 compares; compare with E, S, Q
O - 10 - 3 compares; compare with E, S, Q
N - 11 - 4 compares; compare with E, S, Q, I

Total number of compares = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 3 + 3 + 4 = 26
